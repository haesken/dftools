Things to check before committing/tagging things:

- `df_install.py` version number matches the new tag
- the argparse help strings and the readme are update to date with each other
- the readme is generally up to date
- code fold markers are all correct
- that `df_install` and `init_editor` were built correctly (using virtualenv?)
